# Fitting A Linear Regression Model
In this exercise I used a real-world dataset, "House Sales in King County, USA" from Kaggle to fit linear regression model to
it and predict house price using regression. The data is noisy, messy and difficult so part of this exercise was to preprocess and "clean" it.

## Polynomial Fitting
Another part of the exercise was to use the linear regression model, for a problem that at first sight doesn't
seem like that, But only after transforming the input.
For this part I used a modified subset of the "Daily Temperature of Major Cities" dataset from Kaggle.
